### Setup Web-App

> **Note** </br>
> If the settings/configurations are not specified in this guide, you can leave them as default or you can specify the values with your own.

1. Select the same AWS region as the [infrastructure](#setup-infrastructure) that has been deployed

2. Connect to EC2 instance that already created

3. Install required packages:

   - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
   - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
   - [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

4. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/zrierc/mqtt-simple-pubsub) and navigate to [`web/`](/web/)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zrierc/mqtt-simple-pubsub.git && cd mqtt-simple-pubsub/

   cd web/
   ```

5. Install required dependencies

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

6. Setup enviroment variables

   - Copy `.env` boilerplate

     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```

   - Fill the required environment variables

     ```env
     BASE_URL=[http://your-domain]
     VITE_MQ_HOST=[wss://your-amazonmq-wss-endpoint:61619]
     VITE_MQ_TOPIC=broadcast
     VITE_MQ_USERNAME=[your-amazonmq-username]
     VITE_MQ_PASSWORD=[your-amazonmq-password]
     ```

7. Build web-app

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

8. Start web-app

   > You can customize the port number. (e.g., `--port 80`)

   ```bash
   npm run preview --port 3000
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn run preview --port 3000
   ```

   > **Note** </br>
   > You can also running this web-app behind [reverse proxy Nginx](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/) or using [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/).

9. Open/test your web-app by accessing the public IP or public IPv4 DNS via web browsers.

#### üòï Are you stuck?

Check this common issues:

<details>
  <summary>‚ö† Can't access web-app</summary>

- Expose app publicly by adding argument `--host 0.0.0.0`. For example:
  ```bash
  yarn run preview --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
  ```
- Make sure your web-app running properly and can publicly accessible or if you use Nginx as reverse proxy make sure you configure Nginx properly.
- Check the security group that attached to EC2 Instance. Make sure the port that used to run the web-app is added to the inbound rules security group.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùå Data/message on web-app not appears</summary>

Check the browser console. If you got an error with message:

```
WebSocket connection to 'wss://abcd-ef-123-4567890.mq.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com:61619/' failed
```

or

```
Firefox can‚Äôt establish a connection to the server at wss://localhost:61619/.
```

You probably use the **wrong endpoint and authentication** in `.env` file. Please review and edit `.env` with following rules:

- For endpoint, use the Amazon MQ websocket (`wss`) endpoint. [Review setup `.env` file for web-app (step 6)](#setup-web-app).
- Use the same username and password as when filling out authentication and authorization on Amazon MQ. [Review setup Infrastructure (step 6)](#setup-infrastructure).

## üß™ Testing

1. Invoke Lambda function with following event:

   > **Note** </br>
   > Feel free to change the `message` value.

   ```json
   {
     "message": "hello from lambda!"
   }
   ```

   <details>
    <summary>üé¨ Behind the Scene</summary>

   - Lambda will receive the event that you sent, get `message` value and proccess it.

   - After the event being proccessed, **Lambda will publish** it to topic called `broadcast` on Amazon MQ using `mqtt` protocol.

   - Each payload stored in Amazon MQ.

   </datails>

2. Open the web-app that you've already deployed in web browsers and you will see message that you sent in Lambda.

   > **üí° TIP**
   >
   > If data are not shown, invoke Lambda again by repeating step 1.

   <details>
   <summary>üé¨ Behind the Scene</summary>

   **Web-app subcribe topic** called `broadcast` on Amazon MQ using web socket (`wss`) protocol and display it in tabular form.

   > **Note** </br>
   > Since the data are not stored in persistent storage, if you refresh your web browsers the data will lost. However, you can still receive data again by invoking Lambda as in step 1.
