### Setup Web-App

> **Note** </br>
> If the settings/configurations are not specified in this guide, you can leave them as default or you can specify the values with your own.

1. Select the same AWS region as the [infrastructure](#setup-infrastructure) that has been deployed

2. Connect to EC2 instance that already created

3. Install required packages:

   - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
   - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
   - [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

4. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/zrierc/mqtt-simple-pubsub) and navigate to [`web/`](/web/)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zrierc/mqtt-simple-pubsub.git && cd mqtt-simple-pubsub/

   cd web/
   ```

5. Install required dependencies

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

6. Setup enviroment variables

   - Copy `.env` boilerplate

     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```

   - Fill the required environment variables

     ```env
     BASE_URL=[http://your-domain]
     VITE_MQ_HOST=[wss://your-amazonmq-wss-endpoint:61619]
     VITE_MQ_TOPIC=broadcast
     VITE_MQ_USERNAME=[your-amazonmq-username]
     VITE_MQ_PASSWORD=[your-amazonmq-password]
     ```

7. Build web-app

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

8. Start web-app

   > You can customize the port number. (e.g., `--port 80`)

   ```bash
   npm run preview --port 3000
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn run preview --port 3000
   ```

   > **Note** </br>
   > You can also running this web-app behind [reverse proxy Nginx](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/) or using [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/).

9. Open/test your web-app by accessing the public IP or public IPv4 DNS via web browsers.

#### üòï Are you stuck?

Check this common issues:

<details>
  <summary>‚ö† Can't access web-app</summary>

- Expose app publicly by adding argument `--host 0.0.0.0`. For example:
  ```bash
  yarn run preview --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
  ```
- Make sure your web-app running properly and can publicly accessible or if you use Nginx as reverse proxy make sure you configure Nginx properly.
- Check the security group that attached to EC2 Instance. Make sure the port that used to run the web-app is added to the inbound rules security group.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>‚ùå Data/message on web-app not appears</summary>

Check the browser console. If you got an error with message:

```
WebSocket connection to 'wss://abcd-ef-123-4567890.mq.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com:61619/' failed
```

or

```
Firefox can‚Äôt establish a connection to the server at wss://localhost:61619/.
```

You probably use the **wrong endpoint and authentication** in `.env` file. Please review and edit `.env` with following rules:

- For endpoint, use the Amazon MQ websocket (`wss`) endpoint. [Review setup `.env` file for web-app (step 6)](#setup-web-app).
- Use the same username and password as when filling out authentication and authorization on Amazon MQ. [Review setup Infrastructure (step 6)](#setup-infrastructure).

</details>

## üß™ Testing

1. Invoke Lambda function with following event:

   > **Note** </br>
   > Feel free to change the `message` value.

   ```json
   {
     "message": "hello from lambda!"
   }
   ```

   <details>
    <summary>üé¨ Behind the Scene</summary>

   - Lambda will receive the event that you sent, get `message` value and proccess it.

   - After the event being proccessed, **Lambda will publish** it to topic called `broadcast` on Amazon MQ using `mqtt` protocol.

   - Each payload stored in Amazon MQ.

   </datails>

2. Open the web-app that you've already deployed in web browsers and you will see message that you sent in Lambda.

   > **üí° TIP**
   >
   > If data are not shown, invoke Lambda again by repeating step 1.

   <details>
   <summary>üé¨ Behind the Scene</summary>

   **Web-app subcribe topic** called `broadcast` on Amazon MQ using web socket (`wss`) protocol and display it in tabular form.

   > **Note** </br>
   > Since the data are not stored in persistent storage, if you refresh your web browsers the data will lost. However, you can still receive data again by invoking Lambda as in step 1.

## Improving Your Web-App

> **‚ùó‚ùó First Thing First**
>
> To follow this section you MUST complete [Setup Environment](#setup-environment) section and mare sure everything runs well.

Welcome to the improvement section of this mini workshop! Here you will learn how to improve and optimize your web-app for production such as implement security best practices and add high availability to your web-app.

### Improve Security

#### Infrastructure

1. Implement custom security group to control traffic at instance level.

   Restrict inbound rule by **adding only the necessary ports and traffic to the rule**. For example, if your web-app not using port 3000 anymore you can remove it from security group. Learn more about security group [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-security-groups.html).

2. Implement custom network ACLs to control traffic at the subnet level.

   You can create custom network ACLs for each subnet types. For example, create custom network ACLs for public subnet(s) and private subnet(s). Learn more about network ACLs [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-network-acls.html).

   > **Note** </br>
   > Please remember that network ACLs are stateless, which means that any changes applied to an inbound rule will not be applied to the outbound rule (and vice versa). Also, when you create custom network ACLs by default it will deny all traffic both inbound and outbound traffic.
   >
   > There's an associated outbound rule that allows responses to incoming traffic, you can do this by adding [ephemeral ports](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-network-acls.html#nacl-ephemeral-ports) to outbound rule. **Only add the required port and traffic to the rule**.

## Clean Up Resources

To minimize the cost, make sure you **delete resources used in this workshop when you are finished**. Follow the sequence according to the steps to delete the AWS resources:

1. Delete Amazon MQ broker.

   > Click [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/amazon-mq-deleting-broker.html) to read more how to delete Amazon MQ broker.

2. Delete/terminate EC2 instance.

   > Click [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html#terminating-instances-console) to read more how to terminate EC2 instance.

3. Delete NAT Gateway.

   Step to delete NAT Gateway via [AWS Web Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/):

   - Access the [Amazon VPC console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?#).
   - In the nativation pane, choose **NAT Gateways**.
   - Select the option button for the NAT Gateway, and then choose **Actions, Delete NAT gateway**.
   - When prompted, enter **delete** and then choose **delete**.

   > **Note** </br>
   > The NAT gateway entry might remain visible in the Amazon VPC console for an hour after removal.

   To delete a NAT gateway with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), see [delete-nat-gateway](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/ec2/delete-nat-gateway.html).

   > **Warning** </br>
   > After deleting NAT Gateways, if you no longer need the Elastic IP address that was associated with a public NAT gateway, **release the Elastic IP address**. [Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-eips.html#release-eip).

4. Delete VPC.

   > Click [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/delete-vpc.html) to read more how to delete VPC.

   > **Note** </br>
   > If you delete a VPC using the Amazon VPC console, VPC components (e.g. Subnets, Security Groups, Route Tables, Internet Gateways, etc) are also deleted.

5. (optional) Delete credentials that stored in AWS SSM parameter store or AWS Secret Manager.

   > If you storing your credentials (username & password) Amazon MQ that stored in AWS SSM parameter store or AWS Secret Manager you can delete it by folllowing these step:
   >
   > - [Deleting AWS SSM parameter store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/deleting-parameters.html).
   > - [Deleting Secret Manager secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_delete-secret.html).

6. (optional) Delete credentials that associated to AWS CLI.
   > Although it costs no money, for security reasons, you can delete credentials used in the AWS CLI if you don't use them anymore.
